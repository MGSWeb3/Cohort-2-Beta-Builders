##  Introduction

In the world of Web3, **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)** are best known for representing digital art and collectibles. But they’re evolving beyond JPEGs.

Enter the **Cohort NFT** — a new way to verify **participation, collaboration, and community** on-chain.

> Think of a Cohort NFT as a **digital badge** that proves you were part of a specific experience, course, event, or challenge — with others.

##  What Is a Cohort NFT?

A **Cohort NFT** is a unique, often non-transferable token that represents your **involvement in a shared milestone or event**.

These NFTs are typically issued:
- At the end of a training program
- After completing a DAO sprint or hackathon
- As a reward for security awareness challenges
- Or simply as proof that you were part of a community initiative

 In short: **It’s not about ownership, it’s about participation.**

##  Why Do Cohort NFTs Matter?

###  1. Proof of Participation  
They show *you were there* — creating a verifiable on-chain memory.

###  2. On-Chain Reputation  
Cohort NFTs can build your Web3 résumé. Each NFT is a stamp of trust and engagement.

###  3. Community Belonging  
Being part of a cohort creates connections. Cohort NFTs reflect that shared identity.

###  4. Access Control  
Holders might gain access to exclusive spaces, governance rights, or early product launches.

##  How Cohort NFTs Work (Step-by-Step)

1. A project announces a **Cohort NFT** drop for eligible participants.
2. You complete the required activity (event, course, quest, etc.).
3. You claim (mint) the NFT to your wallet.
4. It becomes a **permanent, verifiable record** of your involvement.

>   Most Cohort NFTs are **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)** — non-transferable and tied to your wallet. No flipping. Just proof.
