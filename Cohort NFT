## 👋 Introduction

In the world of Web3, **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)** are best known for representing digital art and collectibles. But they’re evolving beyond JPEGs.

## 🚀 What Is a Cohort NFT?

A **Cohort NFT** is a unique, often non-transferable token that represents your **involvement in a shared milestone or event**.

These NFTs are typically issued:
- At the end of a training program
- After completing a DAO sprint or hackathon
- As a reward for security awareness challenges
- Or simply as proof that you were part of a community initiative

📌 In short: **It’s not about ownership, it’s about participation.**
