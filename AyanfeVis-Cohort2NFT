MGSWeb3 Cohort2 NFT is creativity, it’s exploration and going beyond the acts perceived as normal
This creativity is more than writing or drawing, it involves exploiting the mind and its depth, drawing resources from technology and putting all into a place to serve as a badge, a badge that represents MGSWeb3 and her members.
The NFT is not just piece of art. 
Then why does it exist you may ask..
 It exists because it’s our own version of the google authenticator. A proof of belonging to a community of creative minds. It’s a reward to showing up, being consistent and honoring the community in MGSWeb3
What does the Cohort2 NFT represent?
It represents you; your part in the body of makers and trailblazers. It is able to tell a little part of your story or work before you do,
It also represents MGSWeb3 and all that it stands for. 
Oh yes! There’s an icing on the cake, your NFT, represents you not only digitally but also onchain!!
So yes, look forward to it.
