    I present to you the new and improved MGSWeb3 Cohort 2 NFT, designed by our cohort members who put their efforts into the NFT design. NFT (Non-Fungible Tokens) are unique digital assets that represents ownership. 

WHY IT EXIST

    This Cohort 2 NFT exist to provide a secure way to put the MGSWeb3 community out there, to show them that this cohort is something big and beautiful, not only allowing creators to monetize their work but provide a place for them in the web3 job market. This NFT help to build this community with love, passion and like-mindedness. This NFT exist to stop the saying that "drawing and coloring is a distraction, drawing and coloring is childish" becuase it's not.

HOW IT REPRESENTS OUR COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP

    This NFT represents a new form of community ownership in web3, where, we community members, can own and trade our unique digital assets. This NFT have made us a role model for other communities to rise, creating, buying, selling and trading NFTs.
