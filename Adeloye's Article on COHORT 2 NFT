### INTRODUCTION TO THE COHORT 2 NFT
this article will be explaining the MGSWEB3 cohort NFT in all totality;

Launching an NFT is a useful way for a Web3 project to turn its vision into something people can own, wear like a badge, and brag about in the web3 space. It’s not just about art or tokens; it’s about building identity, and rewarding those who believe in the mission before the world catches on.

MGSWeb3 isn't just pricing an art, but it's giving it out at a cost. 

## Back story:
The cohort 2 NFT isn't one like another, it's an NFT minted and earned through sweats and efforts of our unsung heroes, a combination of art, sweat and metal. They who travailed through the jungle and thorns of time and space in search for knowledge. Yes they succeeded, they got the knowledge, but at what cost?, they were covered with scars from the journey, the thorns of the jungle showed no mercy, they didn't! Yet our heroes remain Unsung; is this the thanks they get!?

Here is your chance to sing their praises, let the echoes of their song travail as they themselves did to each corners of the earth. In the sky, into the deep, in time and in space, let their song be heard!

Taste of their adventures and receive a badge to testify of their triumph.


## What is this NFT?
This NFT is essentially a badge, but not just any badge. It runs on a progressive badge system developed and owned by MGSWeb3. It represents proof of effort, skill, and growth within the community. It is the reward for price paid only by efforts.

## How Do You Get This NFT?

As mentioned earlier, this isn't just a badge handed out randomly.
You earn this NFT by completing a series of curated challenges and tasks. Each challenge reflects your contribution, creativity, and consistency.

## Why Was This NFT Created?

This NFT was created to establish a structured reward and ranking system within the MGSWeb3 community. It encourages decentralization by ranking creatives based on the effort they invest and the challenges they complete.
The higher your rank, the more access and opportunities are unlocked for you.


## Mission of the NFT

To establish an open, transparent, and unbreakable system for evaluating and ranking creatives within the MGSWeb3 community; one based on merit, not popularity. And to ensure that "nothing is given, all is earned".
