# TITLE: THIS IS WHAT WEB3 FEELS LIKE


## CONCEPT (EMOTIONAL, REAL, HUMAN)

Web3 can be overwhelming, but there's a beautiful story behind every learner's journey. 
This campaign is about what it actually feels like to grow in Web3, the chaos, the breakthroughs, the confusion, the imposter syndrome, and the little moments that made it make sense.

This NFT reminds me that i didn't just survive web3, i grew in it. 
For me, it marks the moment Web3 started making sense.

When I started this cohort, I had no clue what gas or slippage meant.  
Now I do and this NFT proves that I didn’t just join I grew.

We’re creating a moment that makes you stop and say, Wow i really made it through that.
