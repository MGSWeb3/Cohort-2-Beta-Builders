## What Is an NFT?

**NFT** stands for **Non-Fungible Token**.

### Fungible vs Non-Fungible:

- **Fungible tokens** are interchangeable‚Äîlike money. For example, ‚Ç¶1000 is the same everywhere in Nigeria.
- **Non-fungible tokens**, on the other hand, are **unique** and **not interchangeable**.

### Analogy:

Think of NFTs like **identical twins**‚Äîthey might look the same but have different characteristics (voice, walking style, personality, etc.). Similarly, NFTs might look alike, but they are **uniquely identifiable** via:

- Serial numbers
- Character traits (e.g., wearing a hat, glasses)
