NFT Cohort-2 Video concept_ Success Anthony 

ROUGH IDEA'S 💡 
1. ---

## 📝 Rough Idea – “The Creative Block (Cinematic)”

Theme: That painful moment when you want to create… but nothing’s coming into your head.  
The goal is to capture the **internal tension** of a creative block, then show how joining the MGS Web3 Cohort 2 (and minting the NFT) graduated into a pool of creative energy.

🎥 Key Visual Ideas:
- Slow cuts of the character staring at screen, frustrated (different camera angles are at play here)
- Tossing paper into trash
- Sighing, scrolling endlessly on TikTok
- Pouring water slowly, pacing the room
- Glitchy moment: phone buzzes → NFT mint prompt
- NFT = spark
- Character sits up, opens DaVinci Resolve, smiles, starts writing again
- Ends with a pile of written scripts and a calm confident smile

🧠 Tone: cinematic, moody at first, uplifting in the end  
🎵 Soundtrack: lo-fi beat building into something hopeful

🗣️ Message: **“You’re not stuck. You just need the right spark(or community)
.**

**ROUGH IDEA**  💡 
 **NFT Superpower**

🎬 Concept:
Person mints the Cohort 2 NFT, and suddenly gets **superpowers** — glowing hands, instant editing skills, teleporting to studios, etc.  
Everything becomes sleek and smooth.
transition and classic jumps are needed here, spinning text, laser effects( effects)

This would basically show the how joining the mgs community suddenly brought about changes and sparks so creativity. 

**WHAT I NOTICED**

My second idea is good for a quick paced action packed video style but 
It feels  too **gimmicky** plus everyone uses this superhero/glow-up trope to show “power” but it doesn’t quite reflect real creative growth.  

I want something more **grounded**, something creatives could **feel** and really relate to  
That’s why I decided to lean into my fist idea for **overcoming blocks**, **finding community**, and **gaining momentum**.

# 🎬 Final Concept – “The Creative Block”

**Platform:** Instagram / TikTok  
**Length:** ~30–40 seconds  
**Style:** Cinematic storytelling with emotional buildup



 🎞️ Script

**Scene 1: The Block**

- [Wide shot] A creator sits at a desk, head in hands.
- [Close-up] shows Blank notebook. Pen tapping repeatedly.( add deep slow tapping sounds plus slow breathing)
- [Montage begins] (this is where the block starts building up,characterexperiences more frustrations)
    - Typing script ideas on a laptop → deleting them.  
    - Scribbling on paper → tossing it into trash.  
    - Scrolling through TikTok → everyone seems more creative.  
Tossing more squeezed paper into the trash at intervals 
    - Deep sigh. Laptop slammed shut.  
    - Takes a sip of water. Slumps into  the couch. 


**Scene 2: The Message**

- [Phone buzzes]  
- [Close-up] Notification:  
  > "Join the MGS Web3 Cohort 2 for Creatives. Mint your NFT now."
- [Screen glitches] Quick cut a picture of the NFT 
  
Another message should pop up showing NFt minted ( these messages could be in holographic form) 

  > Yet another message_ “Membership Confirmed. Welcome to the Cohort.”

Before scene 3 ( a short scene should come up showing the NFT magically turning into a badge on the characters shirt)

**Scene 3: The Spark**

- [Montage returns, but brighter tone]  
    - Screens of community Zoom calls( or Google meet), classes 
    - Chat messages from other creators sharing tips  
    - Content ideas flooding a notes app ( like notion)

**Scene 4: The Comeback**

- [Medium shot] Character sits up, eyes lit and hopfulness returns to face
- Writes script after script until they pile up on the desk 
- Opens laptop → launches DaVinci Resolve    
- [Final shot] He/She cracks their knuckles, smiles at the camera

**Text on screen:**  
> *“From Blocked to Belonging. Welcome to Cohort 2.”*

**Hashtags:**  
`#Cohort2 #CreativeSpark #Web3Creators #MGSweb3`

---

## 🎵 Music Direction

- **Start:** Muffled lo-fi, subtle rain or clock ticking  
- **Middle (glitch/NFT moment):** Ambient whoosh or sound burst  
- **End:** Bright, upbeat lo-fi with soft drums and chimes



 🧠 Why This Concept?

I’ve personally hit creative blocks like this and  
this story shows how being a member or joining the right community can **unstick you**.  
The Cohort 2 NFT is centered as the gateway into entering the MGS Community,
And I want the audience to feel that with this script.
